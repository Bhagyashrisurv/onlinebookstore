<p>Biological science, or biology, is the study of living organisms, such as plants, animals and other living organisms. The subject of biology is divided into many separate fields, such as behavior, human anatomy, botany, physiology, zoology, ecology and genetics.

<br>
<br>

Genetics focus primarily on the study of heredity while physiology looks into the function of living organisms and their parts. Zoology focuses on the study of animals and their behavior and evolution. Ecology is the study of how organisms interact and respond to their environment and its constant changes, and botany is focused on the study of agriculture and individual plants. Finally, human anatomy studies the function of humans and their many parts.</p>
